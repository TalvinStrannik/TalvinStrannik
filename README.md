# Data Scientist Profile

Hi there! My name is Dzianis Sarnatski, and I want to become a Data Scientist. In this repository, I share my projects, research, and skills in data analysis.

## About Me

I really love mathematics and hardware! Therefore, this repository has a special focus on machine learning and data analytics projects on hardware platforms. I love to come up with and try to implement different projects! Some are only in the beginning stages. While working on projects, I learned how to work in a team and mastered business communication skills!

I utilize various tools and technologies in my projects, including:

- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white&labelColor=3776AB)

## Projects

This repository contains several projects in various stages of completion.

Fully completed projects:

- [Spiking-Neuron-Model-For-Embedded-Systems]([https://github.com/TalvinStrannik/Spiking-Neuron-Model-For-Embedded-Systems]): Joint project with S. Yablonsky and V. Lutkovsky.We developed and proposed a new spiking neural model.
- [Methods-of-Molecular-Dynamics-in-Platform-Ruspberry-Pi-4]([link_to_project_2](https://github.com/TalvinStrannik/Methods-of-Molecular-Dynamics-in-Platform-Ruspberry-Pi-4)): Joint project with K. Kolesnikov. We simulated the operation of the Monte Carlo method on the Raspberry Pi4 platform.

Projects I'm working on:
  
- [Tattooing-on-The-Body]([link_to_project_3](https://github.com/TalvinStrannik/Tattooing-on-The-Body)): Personal work with the interesting direction of Diffusion Models.
- [Determination-of-SNP-Sites-In-Human-DNA-genes-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods]([https://github.com/TalvinStrannik/Determination-of-SNP-Sites-In-Human-DNA-genes-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods#determination-of-snp-sites-in-human-dna-genes-using-machine-learning-methods]): The topic of my course work. Complex and interesting at the same time
