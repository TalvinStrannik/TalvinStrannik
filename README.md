# Data Scientist Profile

Hi there! My name is Dzianis Sarnatski, and I want to become a Data Scientist. In this repository, I share my projects, research, and skills in data analysis.

## About Me

I really love mathematics and hardware! Therefore, this repository has a special focus on machine learning and data analytics projects on hardware platforms. I love to come up with and try to implement different projects! Some are only in the beginning stages. While working on projects, I learned how to work in a team and mastered business communication skills!

I utilize various tools and technologies in my projects, including:
